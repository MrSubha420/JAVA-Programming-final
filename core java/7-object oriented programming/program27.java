//Example of composition in java.
/*
 n the above example, a library can have no. 
 of books on the same or different subjects. 
 So, If Library gets destroyed then All books within that particular 
 library will be destroyed. i.e. books can not exist without libraries.
  Thatâ€™s why it is composition.  Book is Part-of Library.
